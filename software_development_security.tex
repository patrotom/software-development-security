\section{Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)}
\label{sec:sdlc}

In this section, we talk about the software development life cycle. It is a fundamental term in software engineering, and it is good first to gain a better knowledge of this process, so we can put it into the context of the development security.

Every controlled process has some form of the life cycle, which determines the particular steps we take from the beginning to the end of the process. If we have a defined process, we can also define the resources and additional information connected to each step of the process. It is not different from the development of a piece of software.

The software development life cycle also defines several steps that determine the process of development of the software. These steps are the application of standard business practices to building software applications. The process is typically divided into six to eight steps. Some project managers may combine, split, or omit some steps, depending on the project's scope. \cite{sdlc_phoenix}

\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{figures/sdlc_stages.jpg}
\caption{A typical SDLC consists of these stages \cite{sdlc_tutorials_point}}
\label{fig:sdlc_stages}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Planning}

Planning is often tightly connected with the requirements analysis. The senior team members often perform it. The inputs mostly come from the customer, sales department, market surveys, and domain experts in the industry. This information is later used to plan the project approach and conduct the feasibility study. \cite{sdlc_tutorials_point}

Another part of the planning may also be quality assurance requirements. These requirements often involve the identification of the risks associated with the project. The risks are often included in the feasibility study's technical part, which may also contain an overview of the security risks. \cite{sdlc_tutorials_point}

\subsection{Defining}

Once the requirements analysis is done, the next step is to clearly and formally document the product requirements, which are later discussed and approved by the customer or the market analysts. There is often a need to redefine these requirements based on customer feedback or feedback from other sources. The redefining can also be connected to the searching for potential security threads and risks. \cite{sdlc_tutorials_point}

\subsection{Designing}

The design involves the architects to come out with the best architecture for the product to be developed. The product of this step is often some form of a design specification. This specification is then reviewed by all important stakeholders and based on various parameters as risk assessment, product robustness, design modularity, etc. \cite{sdlc_tutorials_point}

Some aspects of the design include architecture, user interface, platforms, programming, and communications. The security aspect is also often a part of this step. It defines the measures to be taken to secure the application and can involve things like SSL encryption, password protection, and secure storage of user credentials. \cite{sdlc_phoenix}

\subsection{Building}

In this stage, the actual code is written, and the product is built. Developers must follow the coding guidelines defined by their organization, and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc., are used to generate the code. The guidelines may include a set of best practices that often help write a better and more secure code. \cite{sdlc_tutorials_point}

The coding process also includes many other tasks. The developers often face tasks like finding and fixing errors and critical glitches. These aspects can often hold up the development process. However, it is also important for the code's overall security to address these issues in the development process. \cite{sdlc_phoenix}

Documentation can also be a guideline of the application's basic features. It can have a form of written documentation like user guides, troubleshooting guides, edge cases analysis, etc. \cite{sdlc_phoenix}

\subsection{Testing}

This step is often a subset of all the stages in the SDLC. However, this step refers to the testing only stage of the product where we detect products' security issues, bugs, glitches, and other types of defects. The defects need to be addressed and reprogrammed accordingly. This step should end only if the product reaches the company's quality standards. \cite{sdlc_tutorials_point}

Much of the testing can also be automated. This also includes security testing like static or dynamic code analysis, etc. \cite{sdlc_phoenix}

\subsection{Deployment}

The deployment involves a formal release of the product in the appropriate market. Sometimes the product deployment happens in stages as per the business strategy of the company. The product may be first released in a limited segment and tested in the real business environment (user acceptance testing). Based on the feedback, the product may be adjusted accordingly. There is also a space for finding potential bugs or security issues not detected by the testing phase. \cite{sdlc_tutorials_point}

Many companies prefer to automate the deployment phase. The automation may be complex and needs to be finely orchestrated not to bring security defects to the deployment process. \cite{sdlc_phoenix}

\subsection{Operation and Maintenance}

At this point, the product is developed and used in the field. However, the operation and maintenance phase is still important. In this step, the users discover and report bugs and security issues that weren't found during coding and testing. These errors need to be resolved, which may spawn new development cycles. \cite{sdlc_phoenix}

Often, a part of this phase is also some form of service-level agreement (SLA) between the customer and provider. This agreement documents what services the provider will furnish and defines the service standards the provider is obligated to meet. This may also include security measures that will be taken by the service provider are defined. Typically, this includes the drafting and consensus on antipoaching, IT security, and nondisclosure agreements. \cite{sla}

\subsection{SDLC Summary}

Based on the steps described above, we may conclude that development security is included in all the SDLC steps (phases). We can ask ourselves the question of how to approach security in the development process. There may be many answers to this question. One possible solution may be to define a set of standards/processes that should be followed throughout the SDLC.

\section{Secure Software Development Processes}

In this section, we look at the three processes which are used to ensure the security during the SDLC. The focus is put on three forefront representatives, namely Microsoft's \textit{Security Development Lifecycle} (SDL) \cite{microsoft_sdl}, OWASP’s \textit{Comprehensive, Lightweight Application Security Process} (CLASP) \cite{owasp}, and McGraw' \textit{Touchpoints} \cite{mcgraw2004software}.

In Section \ref{sec:sdlc} we stated that the security issues are present in all phases of the SDLC. However, the construction of secure software is still largely a matter of guidelines, best practices, and undocumented expert knowledge in many companies. \cite{on_secure_software}

Several advances have been made in the definition of the process for secure software development by the major players in the field like Microsoft or OWASP. The information about the processes are taken from the \textit{Bart De Win's} paper \textit{On the secure software development process: CLASP, SDL and Touchpoints compared} \cite{on_secure_software}.

\subsection{Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) \cite{on_secure_software}}

In 2002, Microsoft made a commitment to follow the so-called ``trustworthy computing'' principle. As a result, the company defined the \textit{Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)}. SDL is a process definition that is composed of a set of activities, which complement Microsoft's development process. These activities are particularly aimed to address security issues during the development process. The following aspects characterize the process:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Security as a supporting quality
    \item Well-defined process
    \item Good guidance
    \item Management perspective
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/sdl_steps.jpg}
\caption{The seven phases of the Security Development Lifecycle Process \cite{sdl_wiki}}
\label{fig:sdl_phases}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Security as Supporting Quality}

The primary goal of SDL is to function as a supportive add-on to the software construction process. It reaches this functionality by increasing the quality of functionality-driven software. This is done by improving its security approach.

Security activities are most often related to functionality-based construction activities. For example, threat modeling starts from architectural dependencies with the external systems. However, the architecture itself could, in fact, reduce such threats in the first place. The SDL defines many similar approaches to enrich the quality of the development security.

\subsubsection{Well-defined Process}

From Figure \ref{fig:sdl_phases}, we can see that SDL is well-organized into the phases similar to the SDLC described in Section \ref{sec:sdlc}. Although the stages are security-specific, it is straightforward to map them to standard software development phases -- in the section \ref{sec:sdlc} we concluded that security is often included in all steps of the SDLC.

Furthermore, several activities have continuous characteristics. This includes threat modeling and education. Thus, the SDL process incorporates support for revising and improving intermediate results.

\subsubsection{Good Guidance}

SDL achieves good guidance by specifying the method that must be used to execute activities.  On average, these specifications are concrete and often somewhat pragmatic. For example, the attack surface reduction is guided by a flow chart. Another example can be threat modeling, which is described as a set of sub-processes. As a result, the execution of an activity is quite achievable, even for less experienced people.

\subsubsection{Management Perspective}

Often in the companies, we can observe that security as quality has to be managed in order to be realized in practice. SDL takes a management perspective for the description of many activities. This is a very convenient feature given the inherent complexity of the security.

\subsection{Comprehensive, Lightweight Application Security Process (CLASP) \cite{on_secure_software}}

CLASP is a \textit{lightweight} process for building secure software. It consists of 24 top-level activities, which are general enough to be tailored to the development process in progress. Some of the key features include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Security at the center stage
    \item Limited structure
    \item Role-based
    \item Rich in resources
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/owasp_clasp.png}
\caption{SDLC \& OWASP Guidelines \cite{owasp_clasp}}
\label{fig:sdlc_owasp}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Security at Center Stage}

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:sdlc_owasp}, the CLASP framework is mainly proposed for the construction of software in which security takes a central role. The set of activities is fairly broad since they are defined and conceived primarily from a security-theoretical perspective.

\subsubsection{Limited Structure}

CLASP framework offers a certain level of flexibility. It is achieved by the independence of the activities that have to be integrated into the development process and its operating environment. It is up to a particular company to choose the activities to be executed and choose the order of execution. Moreover, the execution frequency is specified per individual activity. The coordination and synchronization of the activities may thus not be straightforward. Besides, the CLASP framework defines two road maps ( ``legacy'' and ``greenfield''), which give some guidance on how to combine the activities into a coherent and ordered set.

\subsubsection{Role-based}

We already mentioned activities, which are the building blocks of the CLASP. The framework also consists of the roles responsible for the finalization and the quality of the results of an activity. These roles can also have a direct impact on the security approach. Roles are used as an additional perspective to structure the set of activities.

\subsubsection{Rich in Resources}

CLASP provides and an extensive set of security resources used as support in the implementation of the activities. For example, one of the resources is a list of 104 known security vulnerabilities in application source code.

\subsection{Touchpoints \cite{on_secure_software}}

Let's introduce Gary McGraw, the author of the \textit{Seven Touchpoints for Software Security}, first:\\

\textit{``Gary McGraw is the CTO of \textit{Cigital, Inc.}, a software security and quality consulting firm providing services to some of the world's best-known companies for a decade. Dr. McGraw is a globally-recognized authority on software security-featured frequently as a keynote speaker at events coast-to-coast as well as internationally.''} \cite{mcgraw_software_security}

Touchpoints describe a set of security best practices that come from the extensive industrial experience of McGraw. The best practices (activities) are grouped together in seven so-called touchpoints. Some of the aspects of Touchpoints include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Risk management
    \item Black vs. white
    \item Flexibility
    \item Examples
    \item Resources
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/touchpoints.png}
\caption{Seven touchpoints (best practices) of software security \cite{mcgraw_software_security}}
\label{fig:touchpoints}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Risk management}

Risk management is an important part of software security. Touchpoints acknowledge its importance and try to bridge the gap by elaborating the \textit{Risk Management Framework (RMF)} that supports the Touchpoints activities.

\subsubsection{Black vs. white}

Touchpoints come with a mix of black-hat and white-hat activities. Both types are equal in the means of necessity. Black-hat activities aim for attacks, exploits, and breaking software -- penetration testing. On the other hand, white-hat activities are more constructive in nature. They cover design, control, and functionality -- code review.

\subsubsection{Flexibility}

Since the Touchpoints are formalized in the form of best practices, we can tailor them and use them for software that already undergoes development. Besides, the documentation provides prioritization of different touchpoints. Thus, the companies are able to gradually introduce the touchpoints, starting from the most important ones.
